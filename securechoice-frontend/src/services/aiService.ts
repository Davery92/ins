Based on your uploaded documents, here's what I found:

**General Liability Options:**
• Carrier A: $2,400/year, $1M per occurrence, $2M aggregate
• Carrier B: $3,100/year, $2M per occurrence, $4M aggregate  
• Carrier C: $2,800/year, $1M per occurrence, $3M aggregate

**Professional Liability Comparison:**
• Option 1: $1,800/year, $1M limit, $5K deductible
• Option 2: $2,200/year, $2M limit, $2.5K deductible

**Recommendation:** Carrier B offers superior protection with higher limits that better align with your business risk exposure, especially for the additional $700 annual investment.

Would you like me to analyze specific coverage areas like product liability, premises liability, or cyber coverage?`;

    // Risk assessment queries
    if (lowerPrompt.includes('risk') && (lowerPrompt.includes('factor') || lowerPrompt.includes('assess'))) {
      return `**Business Risk Assessment Report**

I've identified several risk factors based on your commercial policies:

**High Risk Areas:**
🔴 Inadequate cyber liability coverage ($100K) - Recommend minimum $1M for data breach costs
🔴 No umbrella policy - Business assets exposed above primary limits
🔴 Workers comp experience mod above 1.0 - Safety program improvements needed

**Medium Risk Areas:**
🟡 Limited professional liability coverage - Consider increasing to $2M minimum
🟡 No business interruption coverage - Revenue loss exposure during claims
🟡 Commercial auto fleet without hired/non-owned coverage

**Low Risk Areas:**
🟢 Adequate general liability limits ($2M aggregate)
🟢 Property coverage includes replacement cost
🟢 Current on premium payments with good carrier ratings

**Immediate Recommendations:** 
1. Add $5M umbrella policy ($800-1,200/year)
2. Increase cyber coverage to $1M ($600-900/year)
3. Implement safety training program to reduce workers comp mod`;

    // Savings opportunities

I found several opportunities to reduce your business insurance costs:

**Immediate Savings Opportunities:**
• Package policies with one carrier: Save $2,400-4,800/year
• Increase general liability deductible to $2,500: Save $800/year
• Install security system (property): Save $600/year
• Fleet safety program (commercial auto): Save $1,200/year

**Risk Management Savings:**
• Workplace safety training (workers comp): Save $1,800/year
• Cyber security training program: Save $400/year
• Professional development/certifications: Save $300/year

**Long-term Strategies:**
• Claims-free discount accumulation: $1,000+/year potential
• Industry association group coverage: 10-15% savings
• Captive insurance participation: 15-25% savings for larger businesses

**Total Potential Annual Savings: $8,000-12,000**

The biggest opportunity is packaging your coverage with a commercial lines specialist. Would you like me to show you specific bundling options?`;
